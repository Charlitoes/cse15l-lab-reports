**Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem**

 1. Examples of `cd`, `ls`, and `cat` with no arguments.

ALL THESE EXAMPLES USED `/home` AS THE WORKING DIRECTORY.
(unless stated otherwise)
   
`cd` with no arguments would bring us back to our home directory
when we use `cd` within a directory such as `/lecture1/messages` it would bring us back to the home directory
   
`ls` with no arguments would show all the directories and files that are within the home directory

`cat` with no arguments would be an error since we don't have a specific path we want to `cat` but instead if we were to have no argument it would print out whatever we inputted after we type the command `cat`

 2. Examples of `cd`, `ls`, and `cat` with a path to a directory as an argument.

ALL THESE EXAMPLES USED `/home` AS THE WORKING DIRECTORY.

`cd` with a path to a directory would take us to the directory that we inputted

`ls` with a path to a directory would show us the files/directories within the directory we inputted

`cat` with a path to a directory would give us an error and it would tell us that we aren't putting in a path to a file, but a path to an argument.

 3. Examples of `cd`, `ls`, and `cat` with a path to a file as an argument.

ALL THESE EXAMPLES USED `/home` AS THE WORKING DIRECTORY.

`cd` with a path to a file would give us an error since we are trying to move into a directory but the path leads us to a file

`ls` with a path to a file would tell us the file path

`cat` with a path to a file would print out what is stored inside the file.
