Part 1: Bugs

A failure-inducing input for the buggy `ArrayTests.java` program would be if we were to put more than 1 number in the array
in the `testReverseInPlace` function. 

Example of the function:
`	public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 , 4, 5};
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 5, 4, 3 }, input1);
	}`

This would give us a test failure since the `reverseInPlace` method isn't actually reversing the array. 



An input that wouldn't produce a failure in the `ArrayTests.java` program would be if we were to put no elements or 1 element
in the array 

Example of the function: 
`	public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, input1);
	}`

The reason for this is that since there is nothing to be reversed or if there were only 1 element there wouldn't be any
change within the array itself and it would stay the same.
